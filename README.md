This SAS-based SDTM simulator was created with a very narrow focus: to facilite the programming of displays utilizing safety data (AE, EG, LB, VS) prior to receipt of the first live cut of data. 

The folders in this repository contain:

* data  
  * SDTM datasets generated by the macros.
* examples  
  * Programs which call the macros to generate the SDTM datasets (examples/ae.sas generates data/ae.sas7bdat).
* macros  
  * Macros used to generate SDTM datasets.
* meta  
  * Metadata to be applied to the SDTM datasets (version 3.2).

The programs in the examples folder generate a very specific style of SDTM data. If you'd like something a little different, start modifying the example programs. If you'd like something a lot different, start modifying the macros.
